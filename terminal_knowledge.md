## Terminal Reflection

### 1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose to use the **VS Code Integrated Terminal** running **PowerShell**.It allows me to run commands directly next to my code without `Alt-Tab`bing to a separate window, saving me from typing `cd` commands every time I open the editor.

### 2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

For now, I have kept the customization minimal to focus on functionality. It inherits the font settings (Fira Code or Consolas) from my VS Code editor for consistency.And I choose VS Code color theme (Dark Mode), which is easier on the eyes during long coding sessions.

### 3. What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command is basic navigation combined with VS Code shortcuts:

- **`code .`**: Typing this in a terminal instantly opens the current folder in VS Code.
