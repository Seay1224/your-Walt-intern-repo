## Research & Learn

### 1. Risks of using a laptop without external peripherals

Working directly on a laptop forces a trade-off:

- If the screen is low (on the desk), I have to look down, causing **"Tech Neck"** (neck strain).
- If I raise the laptop to eye level without an external keyboard, my arms are too high, causing **wrist and shoulder strain**.
- **Result:** Poor posture, fatigue, and potential long-term repetitive strain injuries (RSI).

### 2. Ergonomic equipment for better posture

- **Laptop Stand:** To raise the screen to eye level[cite: 860].
- **External Keyboard & Mouse:** Allows me to keep my elbows at a 90-degree angle while the screen remains high.
- **Ergonomic Chair:** Provides lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of the spine[cite: 860].

### 3. Ideal Adjustments

- **Monitor Height:** The top of the screen should be at or slightly below eye level[cite: 860].
- **Chair Position:** Feet should be flat on the floor (or on a footrest), and knees should be level with hips.
- **Lighting:** Good lighting is essential to prevent eye strain[cite: 860].

### 4. Daily Habits

- **Movement Breaks:** Taking scheduled breaks to stretch and prevent fatigue[cite: 861].
- **20-20-20 Rule:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.

## Reflection

### 1. Equipment changes I can make

- **Current Setup:** I was looking down at my laptop screen.
- **Improvement:** I will connect my laptop to an external monitor. If I travel, I will use a portable laptop stand and a Bluetooth keyboard.

### 2. Behavioural changes to reduce strain

- **Sitting Upright:** I will consciously check if I am hunching over.
- **Micro-breaks:** Instead of coding for 3 hours straight, I will use the Focus Bear app to enforce breaks every 50 minutes.

### 3. Reminders

- **Tool:** I will use **Focus Bear**'s built-in movement breaks feature. It blocks the screen and forces me to do a stretch (e.g., deep breathing or yoga)[cite: 866], which is perfect for resetting my posture.

## Task: Workspace Adjustment

### 1. Adjustments Made

- **Monitor:** I have raised my external monitor so my eyes align with the top third of the screen.
- **Peripherals:** I am now using an external mechanical keyboard, allowing my shoulders to relax.

### 2. Equipment Identified

- **Item:** A dedicated Laptop Stand (or a stack of books as a temporary fix).
- **Benefit:** Elevates the screen to prevent neck flexion.

### 3. Habit Documentation

**Change:** "The 50-Minute Reset"
**Result:** I enabled Focus Bear's break timer today.

- _Observation:_ At 11:00 AM, the app blocked my screen for a "Deep breathing" exercise[cite: 866]. Initially, it felt interrupting, but after 1 minute of breathing, I returned to the code feeling sharper and with less tension in my shoulders.
