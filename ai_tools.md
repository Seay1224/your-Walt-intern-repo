##  AI Tools Researched & Tested

I have experimented with the following AI tools to assist my development workflow:

### 1. GitHub Copilot (VS Code Extension)
* **Usage:** Installed directly in VS Code to provide real-time code autocompletion.
* **Experience:** It acts like a "smarter IntelliSense." It's excellent for predicting the next few lines of code, especially when writing repetitive boilerplate patterns in NestJS (like creating DTO properties).

### 2. Gemini / ChatGPT (Chat-based Assistants)
* **Usage:** Used for explaining complex concepts (like "Why use Pull Requests?") and generating documentation templates.
* **Experience:** Great for high-level architectural questions and debugging error messages. I pasted a Git error log, and it immediately explained the cause.

##  Experimentation & Reflection

### 1. What worked well?
* **Boilerplate Generation:** AI is incredibly fast at generating standard Markdown documentation and basic code structures (e.g., "Create a User Entity with these 5 fields").
* **Concept Explanation:** Asking "Why do we use DTOs in NestJS?" gave me a clear, concise answer that was faster than reading a 10-page tutorial.

### 2. What didn't work?
* **Context Awareness:** Sometimes the AI assumes a wrong file structure if I don't provide enough context. It might suggest code that conflicts with my specific project configuration.
* **Over-reliance:** There is a temptation to accept AI code without reading it. I learned that I must review every line to ensure it actually does what I intend.

### 3. When is AI most useful for coding?
AI is most useful as a **"Force Multiplier"** in two scenarios:
1.  **Unblocking:** When I'm stuck on a specific error or don't know the syntax for a command.
2.  **Drudgery:** Automating tedious tasks like writing test cases or documentation, allowing me to focus on the core logic.
