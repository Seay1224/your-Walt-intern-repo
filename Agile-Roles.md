## Key Roles in an Agile Team

### 1. The Core Team

- **Developers:** The engine of the team. We design, code, test, and maintain the software. We turn requirements into working features.
- **QA (Quality Assurance):** The safety net. They test the software to find bugs before the users do. They ensure the definition of done is met.
- **Product Manager (PM):** The "Why" and "What". They decide what features to build based on user needs and business value. They prioritize the backlog.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM):** The "How". They facilitate the process, remove blockers for the team, and ensure we are following agile principles (similar to a Scrum Master).

- **Other Supporting Roles:**
- **Stakeholders:** The people who have an interest in the project (investors, users, other departments).
- **UX/UI Designers:** They design how the product looks and feels before developers build it.

## Collaboration: Kanban vs. Scrum

| Feature      | Scrum Collaboration                                            | Kanban Collaboration                                               |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning** | Done in a dedicated **Sprint Planning** meeting every 2 weeks. | Done **continuously** or "Just-in-Time" when the backlog runs low. |
| **Syncing**  | Daily Stand-up meetings are mandatory.                         | Syncs happen as needed, focusing on the board (Walk the Board).    |
| **Reviews**  | Formal **Sprint Review** at the end to show work.              | Showcasing work happens as soon as a feature is deployed.          |
| **Focus**    | "Did we finish the Sprint goal?"                               | "Is the work flowing? Are there bottlenecks?"                      |

## Reflection & Task

### 1. My Role and Contribution

As a Backend Intern, my role is to independently pick up tasks and build the "logic layer" (APIs). I contribute by:

- **Self-Management:** Proactively finding solutions in the codebase before asking for help.
- **Hybrid Collaboration:** Combining asynchronous updates (Discord) with synchronous communication (Daily Stand-ups) to ensure efficient information flow.

### 2. Role Overlap & Interactions

- **With the Team (via Discord & Stand-ups):** I rely on the whole team through discord and stand up
  - **Async (Discord):** I use Discord for non-urgent code discussions and sharing updates.
  - **Sync (Daily Stand-up):** I use the **Daily Stand-up** to ask complex questions that are hard to type out and to flag blockers that need immediate attention.
- **With Jeremy (Team Lead):** If the stand-up or Discord discussion doesn't solve a critical issue, I email Jeremy for high-level guidance.

## Task: My Agile Role & Collaboration Plan

### 1. How my role fits into the Agile team

I act as an autonomous "node" in the network. My job is to maintain flow by unblocking myself through research, asking precise questions in stand-ups, and ensuring my blockers are visible to the team.

### 2. Collaboration Improvement Plan

**Selected Channel:** Daily Stand-up

**Actionable Step to Improve Teamwork:**
I will improve teamwork by **coming prepared to Stand-ups**.

- **Current State:** I will ask questions during the short meeting.
- **Improvement:**
  1.  Attempt to solve the issue myself first.
  2.  If unsolved, note it down and **summarize** the key technical hurdles.
  3.  Present this summary concisely during the Stand-up to get targeted advice.

- **Benefit:** This respects the team's time and ensures I get the right help immediately without turning the stand-up into a long debugging session.
