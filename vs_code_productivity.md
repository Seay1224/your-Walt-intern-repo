## ⌨ Top 10 Useful VS Code Shortcuts 

I have researched and tested these shortcuts specifically for my Windows development environment.

1.  **Quick Open (Go to File):** `Ctrl + P`
    * *Why:* Essential for large NestJS projects. I can type `user.controller` and jump straight there without clicking through folder layers.
2.  **Go to Definition:** `F12` or `Ctrl + Click`
    * *Why:* Instantly see how a function or class is implemented in another file.
3.  **Go to Line:** `Ctrl + G`
    * *Why:* Critical for debugging. When a stack trace says "Error at line 45", this takes me there instantly.
4.  **Add Cursor (Multiple Cursors):** `Ctrl + D`
    * *Why:* **The Game Changer.** Selects the next occurrence of the highlighted word. Perfect for renaming a variable in multiple places simultaneously.
5.  **Move Line Up/Down:** `Alt + Up / Down`
    * *Why:* Moving code logic into a `try-catch` block or reordering function calls without cutting and pasting.
6.  **Copy Line Down:** `Shift + Alt + Down`
    * *Why:* Rapidly duplicating lines, perfect for defining multiple properties in a DTO or Entity.
7.  **Format Document:** `Shift + Alt + F`
    * *Why:* Instantly runs Prettier to fix indentation, ensuring my code always looks professional.
8.  **Toggle Breakpoint:** `F9`
    * *Why:* Setting breakpoints on the fly to inspect variables during runtime.
9.  **Start/Continue Debugging:** `F5`
    * *Why:* Starts the debugging session or jumps to the next breakpoint.
10. **Toggle Integrated Terminal:** `Ctrl + ` ` (Backtick)
    * *Why:* I can run `npm run start:dev` or git commands without leaving the editor window.

##  Reflection

### 1. Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
The **Multiple Cursors (`Ctrl + D`)** shortcut is undoubtedly the most useful. In backend development, we often deal with repetitive structures (like mapping DTOs to Entities). Being able to edit 10 lines at once feels like a superpower and significantly reduces typing fatigue.
Close second is **Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`)**, because manually navigating the file tree in a modular framework like NestJS is inefficient.

### 2. How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?
* **Mental Flow:** Shortcuts allow me to navigate code at the speed of thought. Every time I reach for the mouse, it breaks my focus.
* **Reduced Friction:** Tasks that feel tedious (like formatting code or renaming variables) become instant, making me less likely to procrastinate on refactoring.
* **Ergonomics:** Staying on the keyboard reduces wrist strain compared to constant mouse usage.
