## Research & Learn

### 1.Main Agile Ceremonies

- **Daily Stand-ups:** A short (15-min) sync meeting where we answer: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Do I have any blockers?
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):**
  - _Scrum:_ A dedicated meeting to plan the next 2 weeks of work.
  - _Kanban (Our Focus):_ Since we use Kanban, we don't have big planning events. instead, we do **Continuous Prioritization**—as soon as the "To Do" column runs low, the Product Manager moves new tickets to the top.
- **Retrospectives:** A meeting to look back at the process (not the code). We ask: "What went well?" and "What can we improve?" to make the team faster next time.
- **Backlog Refinement:** A session to clean up future tickets, adding details and estimates so they are ready for developers to pick up.

### 2. Asynchronous & Cross-Timezone Collaboration

Agile teams (especially remote ones like ours) rely on **Asynchronous Communication** to bridge time zones.

- **Writing over Speaking:** We document decisions in Discord or Linear/Jira comments rather than just saying them in a call.
- **Over-communication:** Updating ticket status immediately so a colleague in a different time zone knows exactly where I left off without needing to ask me.

## Reflection

### 1. Alignment & Communication

Agile ceremonies act as "heartbeats" for the team. They prevent us from working in silos. Without Stand-ups, I might spend 3 days stuck on a bug that someone else could solve in 5 minutes. Without Retrospectives, we would keep repeating the same mistakes.

### 2. Most Important Ceremony for Me

**The Daily Stand-up.**

- **Why:** As an intern, my biggest risk is going down a "rabbit hole" and wasting hours on the wrong path. The Stand-up is my safety net—it forces me to vocalize my progress and allows the senior devs to correct my course immediately if I'm stuck.

## Task: Observation & Improvement

### 1. Stand-up Observation

I attended our stand-up. I noticed that the most effective updates are those that link daily tasks to broader project goals. The team focuses heavily on **blockers** rather than just status reporting, which keeps the meeting actionable and short.

### 2. Retrospective Review

As a new intern (Week 1), I have not yet participated in a formal retrospective.I have researched the standard format

### 3. Collaboration Improvement

**Task:** Document one change to improve collaboration.
**Change:** I will maintain a personal **"Weekly Friction Log"**.

- **Action:** Instead of relying on memory for the Retrospective, I will jot down small process blockers (e.g., "broken docs", "environment error") as they happen during the week.
- **Benefit:** This allows me to bring specific, data-backed examples to the Retrospective meeting, helping the team fix root causes rather than just discussing vague feelings.
