##  Research & Learn

### 1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment?
Based on the Focus Bear onboarding guide:
* **Professional:**
    * [cite_start]**Being Proactive:** Suggesting ideas and asking questions instead of waiting to be told what to do[cite: 693, 695, 700].
    * [cite_start]**Overcommunicating:** Sharing progress publicly and asking questions in group channels so others can learn[cite: 703, 705].
* **Unprofessional:**
    * [cite_start]**Being Passive:** Keeping ideas to yourself or waiting for supervisors to chase you[cite: 699, 707].
    * [cite_start]**Relying on Private Messages (DMs):** The policy explicitly lists relying on private messages as a "Don't" because it creates silos and relies on individuals who may not be working full-time.

### 2. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams?
* [cite_start]**Inclusivity:** Embracing neurodiversity and ensuring everyone feels valued[cite: 553].
* [cite_start]**Zero Tolerance:** Understanding that Focus Bear has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination[cite: 874].
* [cite_start]**Public First:** Asking questions in public channels (Discord) to allow for collective problem solving[cite: 705, 896].

### 3. How can you give and receive feedback professionally?
* [cite_start]**Receiving:** Accepting feedback on PRs (Code Review) as a tool for growth[cite: 686].
* **Giving:** Providing feedback on the app itself ("Dogfooding") is a core expectation. [cite_start]I should report what I don't like to help improve the product[cite: 715].

##  Reflection

### 1. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
[cite_start]I will follow the **"Overcommunicate"** principle[cite: 703]. [cite_start]Since we are a distributed team, I will use Discord for real-time updates [cite: 898] and ensure I don't "ghost" the team. I will respect the flexible working hours of others by not expecting instant replies to DMs.

### 2. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
* [cite_start]**Support:** I will reach out to other interns if I see them struggling, fostering the "Stronger Together" value[cite: 556].
* [cite_start]**Engagement:** I will attend standups and sprint planning sessions [cite: 712] and participate actively, not just listen.

### 3. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it?
[cite_start]I will strictly follow the **"Getting Unstuck" Protocol** defined in the onboarding guide[cite: 681, 907, 908]:
1.  [cite_start]**Step 1:** Google / Use AI (ChatGPT/Copilot).
2.  [cite_start]**Step 2:** Ask another intern.
3.  [cite_start]**Step 3:** Ask my Supervisor (Task-related) during standup or in public channels[cite: 681, 907].
4.  [cite_start]**Step 4 (Escalation):** If I have exhausted all options, I will contact **Jeremy**.
    * [cite_start]*Note:* For logistics/IT issues, I will contact the Project Manager[cite: 906].

### 4. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
[cite_start]Proactivity at Focus Bear means **not waiting to be told what to do**[cite: 700].
* If I finish my onboarding tasks early, I will ask for more work or look for bugs in the app.
* [cite_start]I will use the Focus Bear app daily and report any UX issues I find[cite: 713, 715].

### 5. What are some things you won't do?
* [cite_start]I will **not** rely on Private Messages (DMs) for technical help, as this hides knowledge from the team.
* [cite_start]I will **not** copy-paste proprietary code or confidential user data into AI tools (ChatGPT), although using them for general coding help is encouraged.
