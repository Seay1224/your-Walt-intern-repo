## Resarch & Learn

### 1. The Agile Manifesto
THe Agile Manifesto was created in 2001 to find a better way of developing software.Agile differs from traditional management (Waterfall) by focusing on iterative progress. Instead of planning the entire project upfront and delivering it all at once at the end, Agile breaks the project into small chunks, allowing the team to gather feedback continuously and adapt to changes quickly.
### 2. core values and principles
1.  **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2.  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3.  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4.  **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### 3. Scrum vs. Kanban

| Feature | Scrum | Kanban |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cadence ** | Fixed Sprints (e.g., 2 weeks). | Continuous flow (no fixed timeboxes). |
| **Roles ** | Defined roles (Scrum Master, PO). | Flexible, roles fit the current team. |
| **Change ** | No changes allowed during a Sprint. | Changes allowed anytime if capacity permits. |
| **Philosophy** | Structured iterations. | Visualizing flow and limiting WIP. |

### 4. Why Focus Bear prefers Kanban?
Focus Bear leans towards **Kanban** because of its **flexibility**. It allows the team to prioritize urgent tasks immediately without waiting for a new sprint cycle.

## Reflection

### Benefits & Challenges of Agile
* **Benefits:** We can deliver value to users faster and get feedback early. It prevents building a massive product that no one wants.
* **Challenges:** It requires high discipline and constant communication. Without clear goals, "flexibility" can turn into chaos.

### Useful Agile Principle for Me
**"Deliver working software frequently."**
As an intern, this principle reminds me to commit code often and push small, working features rather than trying to finish everything in one big update. This makes code review easier for my mentors.

## Task
### 1. Scrum vs. Kanban: Main Differences
In my own words, the main differences lie in **flexibility and cadence**:

* **Scrum** is structured like a series of **sprints** (usually 2 weeks). It has strict rules: once a sprint starts, the scope is locked, and no new tasks can be added. It relies on specific roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner.
* **Kanban** is more like a **continuous flow** (like a factory line). There are no fixed timeboxes; tasks are pulled from a backlog as soon as there is capacity. It allows for changes at any time, making it much more flexible for handling urgent bugs or shifting priorities.

### 2. Selected Agile Principle
**"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."**

**Why this is useful for my work:**
As a backend intern, this principle is crucial because it encourages me to submit code updates in **small, functional batches** rather than waiting until a huge feature is perfectly finished.
* It reduces the risk of massive merge conflicts.
* It allows my mentor to review my code earlier and catch mistakes before they become deep-rooted problems.
* It gives me a sense of progress every time I successfully merge a small task.
