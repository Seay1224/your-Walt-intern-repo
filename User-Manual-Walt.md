# 📝 User Manual for Walt

---

## My Role

## How I Work Best

**I do my best work when:**

- I have clear requirements (e.g., a well-defined Linear/Jira ticket).
- I have uninterrupted blocks of time (Deep Work) to focus on coding logic.
- I understand the "why" behind a feature, not just the "how."

**I struggle when:**

- Instructions are vague or requirements change frequently without context.
- I am interrupted constantly by notifications (I prefer checking messages in batches).

## 📡 Communication Style

**I prefer messages to be:**

- **Direct & Context-Rich:** Please skip the "Hi, are you there?" and go straight to "Hi, can you check PR #12? It's blocking me."
- **Async:** I might not reply instantly if I'm coding, but I will reply as soon as I finish my block.

**The best way to reach me is:**

- **Discord:** Post in the public dev channel (so others can learn) or DM for sensitive matters.

**If you need something urgent, do this:**

- Tag me (`@Walt`) in Discord with the word "Urgent" or "Blocker".

## Collaboration & Teamwork

**I work best in a team when:**

- We use the "Pull System" (Kanban)—I pick up tasks when I'm ready.
- Documentation is up-to-date, so I don't have to guess how a module works.

**My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:**

- "Ghosting" on blockers—if I ask a question and get no reply for days, I feel stuck. A simple "I'll look at this later" is much better than silence.

**If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:**

- I am processing the information or taking detailed notes. I prefer to listen first and ask questions at the end.

---

## Focus & Productivity

**I stay focused by:**

- Using the "15-Minute Rule": Trying to solve a problem myself for 15 mins before asking for help.
- Breaking big tasks into small, checkable TODO lists.

**Things that distract me:**

- Unclear priorities (not knowing what is the most important thing to do _right now_).

**The best way to support my productivity is:**

- Give me clear feedback on my Pull Requests so I can merge them and move on to the next task.

---

## Feedback & Growth

**I like feedback to be:**

- **Direct & Specific:** Don't worry about being "too nice" on code reviews. If my code can be optimized, please tell me exactly how. I am here to learn.

**When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:**

- Comment directly on the PR or send me a DM explaining what went wrong and how to avoid it next time.

**I appreciate it when teammates:**

- Share resources or articles that help me understand the system architecture better.

## Fun Facts & Quirks

**One thing people often misunderstand about me is:**

- My directness in text might seem cold, but I'm just trying to be efficient! I'm actually quite friendly.

**A fun fact about me:**

- I'm currently building a blueprint-based game in Unreal Engine 5.6 as a hobby project.

**My work superpower is:**

- **Resilience:** I don't get discouraged by bugs; I see them as puzzles to be solved.
