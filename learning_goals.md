## 🎯 Reflection Questions

### 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?

My primary goal is to bridge the gap between academic theory and production-level software engineering. specifically:

- **Technical:** I want to master the **NestJS** framework and understand how to architect scalable backend services using **Docker** and **AWS**.
- **Process:** I want to learn how to collaborate effectively in a fully remote, asynchronous Agile team, moving beyond just "writing code" to understanding the full lifecycle of a feature request.

### 2. What skills are you most excited to develop?

- **Backend Architecture:** Learning how to structure complex modules in NestJS to keep code clean and maintainable (Clean Architecture).
- **Database Management:** Gaining confidence with **PostgreSQL** and TypeORM in a real-world environment.
- **DevOps Basics:** Understanding containerization with Docker so I can not only write the app but also run it anywhere.

### 3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?

- **Reliability:** I commit to being a "Low-Friction" teammate who communicates proactively and doesn't ghost the team.
- **Code & Docs:** I plan to contribute by tackling backend bugs and, crucially, **writing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for anything I learn. If I struggle to figure something out, I will document the solution so the next intern doesn't have to struggle.
- **Dogfooding:** As a daily user of the Focus Bear app, I will actively report UX bugs and suggest improvements from a developer-user perspective.

### 4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

I feel less confident in **advanced Git workflows** (like interactive rebasing and resolving complex merge conflicts) and navigating a large, existing codebase. I am used to starting projects from scratch, so jumping into a mature repository is a challenge I want to overcome.

### 5. What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success means achieving **High Distinction (180+ points)** in the internship assessment.
Practically, this looks like:

- Merging at least 2-3 significant Pull Requests that improve the product.
- Leaving behind a legacy of clear documentation (SOPs) that helps future interns.
- Gaining the trust of the team so that I can confidently use Jeremy as a referee for my future career.
