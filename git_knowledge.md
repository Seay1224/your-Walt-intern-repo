##  Git Setup & Reflection

### 1. Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
**No, I haven't used Git before.**
This internship is my first time properly using version control. Previously, I would just save files locally. Learning Git now is a huge step for me to understand how software teams collaborate without overwriting each other's work.

### 2. Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I have chosen to use **VS Code's built-in Source Control** combined with the **Integrated Terminal**.
* **Why:**
    * **Context Switching:** I want to minimize switching between windows (e.g., jumping to a separate app like GitHub Desktop breaks flow).
    * **Efficiency:** VS Code allows me to stage changes, write commit messages, and push directly next to my code.
    * **Control:** Using the terminal gives me a better understanding of what is actually happening "under the hood."

### 3. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
The most critical thing I learned was **how to create a branch, open a Pull Request (PR), and merge it.**
I realized that if I didn't learn this workflow (Branch -> Push -> PR -> Merge) and just pushed directly to `main` in a future job, I could cause major issues ("break the build") for the whole team. Understanding this "Safety Buffer" concept was an eye-opener for me.
