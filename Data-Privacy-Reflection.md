##  Research & Learn

### 1. What are the key objectives of Focus Bear's OHS policy?
Based on the onboarding document, the objectives are:
* **Prevent Incidents:** Through regular risk assessments and safety measures.
* **Comprehensive Training:** Ensuring staff are trained in emergency procedures, mental health awareness, and ergonomics.
* **Safety Culture:** Promoting a culture where safety is prioritized.

### 2. What are the specific requirements for your workspace?
* **Ergonomic Setup:** I must have a supportive chair, a screen positioned at eye level, and good lighting to prevent strain.
* **Safe Environment:** The workspace must be clutter-free to avoid trip hazards (e.g., loose cables).

### 3. How should you manage your physical and mental well-being?
* **Regular Breaks:** I should take scheduled breaks to stretch and prevent fatigue. (The Focus Bear app actually enforces this!).
* **Mental Wellbeing:** Prioritize mental health by utilizing wellness resources and practicing mindfulness.

### 4. What is the protocol for reporting incidents?
* **Immediate Reporting:** Any work-related injuries or safety concerns must be reported immediately to the management/supervisor.

##  Reflection

### 1. Assessment of my current workspace
* **Chair:** I have an adjustable office chair with lumbar support.
* **Monitor:** My monitor is slightly too low. **Action:** I will use a stand or books to raise it to eye level today.
* **Lighting:** I have sufficient natural light and a desk lamp for evening work.

### 2. My plan for taking breaks
I often forget to move when I'm "in the zone" coding.
* **Strategy:** I will enable the "break reminders" in the Focus Bear app to force myself to stand up and stretch every 50 minutes.

### 3. Emergency Plan
Since I work from home, I have identified my nearest exit and verified that my smoke alarm is functional.
