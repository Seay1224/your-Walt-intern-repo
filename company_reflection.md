## 1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I believe that Focus Bear is designed to help those who are severely affected by ADHD regain the ability to maintain a regular lifestyle. According to the founder Jeremy's story on the official website, our company was born out of his efforts to bring his life back to normal.

## 2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focusbear has addressed the issue for people with ADHD who struggle to concentrate on tasks that require productivity. Because gentle reminders are easily overlooked by people with ADHD, Focus Bear can cancel the screen-blocking mode by forcibly taking control of the screen.

## 3. Why do you think this mission is important?

Our work can effectively help people with ADHD return to being efficient, punctual and calm. Our app can directly and effectively help people enhance their cognitive abilities and reduce the troubles caused by ADHD.

## 4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

The "Focus Bear" program is of great help to patients with ADHD. I deeply sympathize with these patients who are unable to lead a normal life and carry out normal production due to their illnesses. In addition, our company is currently using AI to determine whether a particular individual should be blocked. I am very interested in this intelligent system.

## 5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

I strongly relate to the concept of **"Doomscrolling"** mentioned on the landing page. Even without an ADHD diagnosis, I often find myself falling into the trap of checking "just one email" in the morning, only to lose an hour of productivity. The idea of a "Morning Routine Enforcer" resonates with me because I know that my day is 10x better when I start with deep work rather than social media. I also see the value in "Smart Breaks", as I often code for too long without moving, leading to burnout.
